# practice1-mattschwab

My name is Matt Schwab. I am a sophmore, currently studying Finance with a secondary majory in Data Science.
I typically spend most of my time tutoring, exercising, and watching movies. 
When organizaing my work, I like to create separate folders for each class, which helps me get organized. I also have a notebook for each class that allows me to take notes and do assignments. I keep a schedule of things to do so that I always get my work done on time.
